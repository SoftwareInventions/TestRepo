We will assume that one is working with an array of numbers and wants to sort in ascending order. 
It is useful to point out, though, that this algorithm is applicable to many different types of lists 
containing any type of comparable data. 

An outer loop iterates through the array starting at the second element. Starting at the current location 
of the outer loop, an inner loop traverses through the list in the opposite direction as the outer loop 
starting at the “current” location of the outer loop. As the inner loop iterates though the elements in the 
opposite direction, it compares the current outer loop element to each of the iterated elements of the inner 
loop in succession and swaps them if they are found to not be in ascending order. 

The inner loop stops iteration for two reasons: <ol><li>The current outer loop element is determined to be in sorted order within the array</li><li>The inner loop reaches the beginning of the array</li>
</ol></pre>

//Insert Sort Example In Java
for (i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
   for (j = i; j > 0; j--) {
      if (array[j] < array[j - 1])
         swap(j, j - 1);
   }
}
