<h2 align=left>WorldFactory Proposal</h3>

<h3 align=left>Gavin Goodsell</h5>

<pre >
	My implementation of the WorldFactory would include essentially be a type of river delta. 
The algorithm used to accomplish this will create small, but frequent “hills.” Any area, 
lower than a certain point, would be filled with water. 

	The algorithm would first divide the world grid, assumed to be a square, into smaller 
squares (hills), with side lengths 1/5th the size of one length of the grid. The side 
length of the hill is rounded down to the nearest whole number.

	In a loop, square hill arrays are made using the side length of the hill. A random  
number of the cells of the hill array that are along the bounds of the square will be 
“removed” as well as any cells of the hill array that are touching a previously removed 
cell. This will happen in a random pattern. 

	Each hill now has a defined and random shape. The hill patterns will be added one by 
one to the overall grid, which will place water where the hill array cells have been 
“removed” and land everywhere else.

//Psudo Code Example
public boolean[][] makeHills(int gridSideLength) {
   int hillSideLenth = (int)Math.Floor(gridSideLength/5);
   boolean[][] hill = new boolean[hillSideLength][hillSideLength];
	
   do {
	
      hill = makeHillShape(hillSideLength);
			
   } while (placeHill(hill));	
}

public boolean[][] makeHillShape (int hillSideLength) {
   boolean[][] hill = new boolean[hillSideLength][hillSideLength];
   cellsToMakeWater = //Randomly generate how many cells to make water
	
   for (; cellsToMakeWater > 0; cellsToMakeWater--) {
      //remove a cell randomly that touches either the 
      //    perimeter of the array block or a lowered cell
   }
	
   return hill;
}

public boolean placeHill(boolean[][] hill) {
   //if no more space on grid, return false
	
   //in a top to bottom, then left to right manner
   //	add the hill values to overall grid
   //  if hill goes outside of grid bounds
   //     return true;
   //  else, continue to add values
