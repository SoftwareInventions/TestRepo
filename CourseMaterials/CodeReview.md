# Code Review Process

## Overview
This document explains the code review process.

## Criteria
We'll evaluate code on by these criteria:

#### Clarity
This includes correct style, good variable names, good code organization for readability, etc.  See the provided style sheet for style rules.

#### Documentation
Appropriate comments, not too many nor too few.  Don't comment every single line, nor things that are reasonably straightforward.  If a reasonable reader could  understand the code without your comment, then the comment should be dropped.

Are comments clear, properly spelled, and grammatical?  Prefer imperative tense in comments, e.g. "Sort the array in increasing order" vs "The array is sorted in increasing order" or "Here, the code sorts the array in increasing order"

You may make reference to external resources, e.g. to explain an algorithm, but your comments must suffice to make your code clear, and to connect it with any externally referenced algorithm, without any other information or explanation.

#### Creativity and Algorithm
How creative, interesting, and original is the algorithm and world generated?

#### Accuracy
Were there bugs found in the review process?

#### Conciseness
Is the code tightly and cleanly written?  Are there significantly briefer and clearer ways it could have been written?

## Submission and Grading Process
When you're ready to have your code reviewed, add your name to the ReviewRequested file, and make your code available under a branch with your login name in the repo.

At least 24 hours ahead of each review cycle, I'll mark random choices from the ReviewRequested list to be reviewed.  Everyone is expected to check that list so they can pre-examine the code and be ready with comments.  I'll grade in-class commentary as part of the class discussion grade, so treat this like any other writeup task.

After the due date I reserve the right to call on you even if you're not in the ReviewRequested list.  But I will first call on those in the ReviewRequested list, and will give 10% extra credit for being on that list *even if I don't call on you right away*. 

It's up to you to determine when you feel your code is ready enough to be reviewed.  Once you've added it to the ReviewRequested list, you can't remove it.

You may see ways to improve your code as others get reviewed, so it's OK, even after you've put your name on the list, to improve your submission *but not after I announce that it's to be reviewed the next cycle*.  People need a stable copy to look at.

## Grading
We'll grade in groups of 3 or 4, and will ask the class to rank each reviewed submission by the listed criteria, 1 to 3/4, best to worst.  I'll assign points by rating.
