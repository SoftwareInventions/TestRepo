   Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
   In this project, you’ll work in teams of 3 to find a customer and a product, and conduct an initial Scrum sprint.
  </p>
  <h2 id="tasks">
   Tasks
  </h2>
  <h3 id="pick-a-team">
   Pick a Team
  </h3>
  <p>
   You must choose from among those who have already finished the individual WorldFactory project, and your team must have my OK.  I will choose teams by Monday if I do not hear from you with any preferences.
  </p>
  <h3 id="find-a-customer">
   Find a Customer
  </h3>
  <p>
   This stage is similar to what you did for database, and indeed may even involve the same customer if you like.  You’re looking for a project that will produce a reasonable backlog and a manageable initial sprint, meaning something you can demonstrate as a working “version 0.1” including automated tests, code reviews, and very basic functionality.
  </p>
  <h4 id="about-ui">
   About UI
  </h4>
  <p>
   I would prefer a project that is a web or mobile application, but I recognize not all teams will have the expertise for this.  A desktop GUI interface, e.g. JavaFX, WinForms is a close second, and a purely text UI is acceptable if necessary.
  </p>
  <h3 id="develop-a-backlog">
   Develop a Backlog
  </h3>
  <p>
   Express your “spec” for the project in the form of a prioritized list of 15-20 PBIs.  This must include 5-10 ready-for-sprint stories, with estimates using ideal days.  It must also include less-refined PBIs, with “shirt size” estimates”.
  </p>
  <h3 id="negotiate-an-initial-sprint">
   Negotiate an initial sprint
  </h3>
  <p>
   Select features for an initial sprint, planning for TDD-style development (see below).  Budget for 16 ideal days of effort, including test development and implementation.  (This is 128 hrs, 43 hrs/member – just under 5 weeks nominal effort for a 3 unit class.)
  </p>
  <h3 id="build-tests">
   Build tests
  </h3>
  <p>
   Write a suite of automated tests for your initial sprint
   <em>
    before you write any code for the features themselves
   </em>
   .  There must be some automated tests, but where these are not feasible (e.g. to test UI) a written test script will suffice.
  </p>
  <h3 id="implement">
   Implement
  </h3>
  <p>
   Build code that satisfies your tests and meets the PBIs for your sprint.
  </p>
  <h3 id="checkpoints-and-submission">
   Checkpoints and Submission
  </h3>
  <p>
   Use a git repository, shared with my Git account (SoftwareInventions).  Use Issues to track your PBIs, and set up a prioritization scheme for different sizes of PBI using labels.  During implementation, each team member must maintain a separate branch, and periodically merge his/her branch into master.  I will want to review each individual’s work via their branch commit history.

   Check with me before proceeding at these points:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    When you have a PBI list in issue form
   </li>
   <li>
    When you have a completed set of tests
   </li>
   <li>
    When your implementation meets the tests and PBI requirements.
   </li>
  </ol>
