#Reading and Reading Assignments

## Week 1
### Thursday
Readings on "understanding the problem"

 * Andrews and Johnson: Chaps 1-3
 * DeMarco: Part I

DeMarco has a clear opinion regarding effective mamagement of software development.  Many of his ideas are widely accepted, but not all are gospel.  Pick one  major idea in this chapter to challenge, and write a couple of paragraphs explaining why you are unconvinced by what he says.  Limit your response to at most 200 words.  I'll grade on the quality of the critique, not its length.  In particular, I seek: clear writing, convincing argument, a supporting fact or two, and concise prose.  In class, we'll ask those picking an idea to defend their view in discussion.

Based on your reading of Andrews and Johnson, offer a defense or rebuttal of this proposition: "Improved languages, libraries, and development tools are the principal driver of large software project success."  Again, limit your comments to at most 200 words.

## Week 2
### Tuesday
  * Andrews and Johnson Chaps 4-5
  * Demarco Part II (Pay special attention to section 10 -- very useful insights)

(150 words max) Do a bit of online research regarding office environment at a leading tech firm that offers what would generally be regarded as a high-perks working environment (Google is a good choice, though there are others).   Are these perks frivolous, or do they serve a constructive business purpose?  What purpose if so?

(200 words max) Based on your reading of Andrews and Johnson, what would they have to say regarding the traditional linear waterfall model of development?  Be specific as to reasons they would support it, or critique it, drawing from what they said in the chapters thus far covered.

### Thursday
  * Sims and Johnson -- the whole thing, it's not lengthy

(150 words max) In a Scrum team, which role would you most like to have, and why?

(150 words max) Briefly explain how you think Scrum addresses the issues of: feature creep, too-optimistic estimation, and the tendency to overdesign.

## Week 3
### Tuesday
 * DeMarco, part 3

Assignment is not DeMarco analysis, but a written response to the prompt at the end of the lecture material on tech writing (Explain insertion sort.)  Post your answer as an HTML file, call it "InsertSort.html", with any accompanying images you like in your personal directory under our TestRepo repository.  Please do this no *sooner* than 9a on the day of class.

### Thursday
 * [Joel Spolsky on Interviewing](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30)

Assignments:

1. Refinement of your writing from Tuesday if you would like to
2. (150 words max) Compare and contrast DeMarco's (part 3) and Spolsky's views
on hiring.  On what points would they agree?  Where might they disagree? 
 
## Week 4
### Tuesday
  * Andrews and Johnson Chap 7 (omit Chap 6)

Assignments:

1. It is interesting to see elements of Scrum philosophy showing up in Chap 7 of Andrews and Johnson.  Write up to 200 words on which aspects of Scrum you see reflected in the Chap 7 points, and which Chap 7 points are not part of Scrum but might make good additions to the core Scrum model.  Explain why you'd add each one.

### Thursday
 * Andrews and Johnson Chap 8
 
 Assignments
 
1. Reflection exercise from Tuesday, now due R.
2. (<= 150 words) Pick a specific accountability challenge described in Chap 8 and contrast the authors' solution with how a Scrum model would handle the challenge.
3. In your fork of CodeWorlds, fill out the VectorTest.java class with a solid set of Vector tests.  Push it to your forked repo, and register a pull request.  We'll do code review on several people's work, and vote on one as the best to actually pull into the repo.  Points toward the Homeworks/Quizzes area will go to the top two or three submits.

## Week 5
### Tuesday
  * Andrews and Johnson Chap 12, 13
  * DeMarco Headings 22, 29-33  (skipping some headings on purpose)

Assignments:

  * (up to 150 words) Andrews and Johnson list a number of characteristics of technical professionals.  How on-target did you find that list? Which of the characteristics describe your outlook?  Which do not?
  * A large university faculty senate meeting might have 50 participants, and meet for an hour.  Estimate its cost in labor, making any reasonable assumptions you like as long (e.g. regarding salary) as you document them.
  * Do the same for a one-page Email written by one member of a software dev team and read by 100 others.
  * Repeat the exercise on writing JUnit tests from last R, but this time fill in HerdAnimalTest, which should provide a general test of all HerdAnimal behaviors.  As before, we'll do code review and select best test cases.

### Thursday
   * Andrews and Johnson Chap 9
   * Rubin, Introduction 
  
Assignments:

  * (up to 150 words) Andrews and Johnson's central point regarding how to choose packaged (aka "third party") software, and what you really gain from it, can be extended by analogy to what you gain as a programmer by using a suite of library classes or functions, which are a sort of "packaged" software.  Think carefully about what they say about packaged software, and extend their ideas to what you would expect to gain from a class or function library, how you would choose between different libraries for a given task, etc.
  * (Up to 250 words) Propose a one-page WorldFactory for GridWorlds, describing what your generated world will look like, with a brief description of the algorithm you'll use to generate it.  This assignment is in the same spirit as the EC assignment at the end of 240, but with some important distinctions.  First, it's an individual assignment, and must be distinctly different from any group project you did in 240.  Second, it's about demonstrating some interesting code patterns, including loops, conditionals, etc, and writing very clean, well-documented, concise, properly styled, code.  We'll be code-reviewing each submission, and ranking them by creativity of code, clarity and style, and conciseness.  You need a design that's more than just some simple pattern-repetitions.

Submit your proposal via Git, as a file "WorldProposal.html" in your personal TestRepo subdirectory, by midnight 2/22.  If you decide to adjust it as you code, that's fine, but if I collect it, I'll grade based on the content as of that time.
  
## Week 6
### Tuesday
  * Rubin, Ch 2, 3

Assignments:
  
* Implement the WorldFactory you proposed on R, and volunteer for code review of your submit, for 10% EC if done by this time.  Implement this as a WorldFactory subclass in a package edu.principia.<yourlogin> in the CodeWorlds source tree, committing it *only* in a branch <yourlogin> of the repository.

### Thursday
   * Read https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/developers-dead-simon-williams  

Assignments:

* Implement your proposed WorldFactory.
* (Up to 150 words) What area(s) of your own background and knowledge would you strengthen to become a "T-shaped" developer?  What could Prin and CSCI do better to make you one?

## Week 7
### Tuesday
  * Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps

Assignments:

 * Ongoing reviews and improvements on WorldFactory
 * (150 words) The DevOps article is part of what I hope to make a series of readings on different roles within software engineering. Write a bit about whether you think you'd enjoy such a role, and why you would or would not.

### Thursday
   * Read up on the distinction between TPM and PM at Amazon.  

https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Technical-Program-manager-and-Product-Manager-at-Amazon
https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Program-Manager-and-Technical-Program-Manager-at-Amazon
(Further web hunting on these two types of roles at other firms, on your initiative.  Quora's a good resource for "inside perspectives" btw.)

Assignments:
   * Code reviews, per usual, but I will break the class into two segments, alphabetically by last name, A-H, K-Z.  We'll try for *four* reviews on R, hoping to move a bit quicker.  I'll assign the first two to A-H, and the second two to K-Z, with the alternate group invited to comment but not required to have deeply pre-read the code.  Expect a quiz on the code for your group.
   * (200 words) The PM/TPM positions are Amazon-specific, but I chose them because I have experience with the distinctions between them, and more importantly because they nicely represent an important spectrum within the broader area of software project management.  Be sure you understand the two roles as described by Amazon.  Then comment on four things:

 1. How this distinction plays out in other software firms -- what types of job positions do MS, Google, IBM, Capital One, etc have that reflect the same spectrum?  You don't have to hunt up every possible company, but get an extra example or two from outside Amazon.
 2. Is there a difference in respect/pay between PM and TPM and does this difference vary per organization?
 3. How the PM/TPM distinction relates to Scrum roles.
 4. Which role you would prefer if you had to choose between them, and why.

## Week 8
### Tuesday
   * Rubin 4-6
   * Team meetings

Assignments:
   * Code Reviews
   * (200 words) It can be said that the standard waterfall specification process has the same problems as buying a 5-gallon jar of mayonnaise.  Describe at least two problems those two things share, based on Scrum philosophy from the Rubin reading. 
   * (100 words each) Write one small (be sure INVEST standards are met) and one epic user story.  You may use any imaginary project you like, but make it distinct from book examples.

### Thursday
Midterm Exam.  I anticipate a closed-book exam with the following elements:

 * Reflection questions on the reading, along the same lines as those we've been doing all term
 * Vocabulary
 * Git commands
 * A technical writing question, judged against the criteria we discussed in class.

## Week 10
### Tuesday
 * Reflections from 9 still potentially collectible
 * Code Review
 * Team meetings

### Thursday
* Midterm handback
* Code Reviews
* Look up online sites describing the roles SQA engineer and SDET.
* (200 words) What are typical SDET or SQA engineer duties?  How do they differ between firms?  Does the typical such role involve coding, and of what sort if so?  What are typical interview questions like?  Would you be interested in such a role?
