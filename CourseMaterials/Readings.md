#Reading and Reading Assignments

## Week 1
### Thursday
Readings on "understanding the problem"

 * Andrews and Johnson: Chaps 1-3
 * DeMarco: Part I

DeMarco has a clear opinion regarding effective mamagement of software development.  Many of his ideas are widely accepted, but not all are gospel.  Pick one  major idea in this chapter to challenge, and write a couple of paragraphs explaining why you are unconvinced by what he says.  Limit your response to at most 200 words.  I'll grade on the quality of the critique, not its length.  In particular, I seek: clear writing, convincing argument, a supporting fact or two, and concise prose.  In class, we'll ask those picking an idea to defend their view in discussion.

Based on your reading of Andrews and Johnson, offer a defense or rebuttal of this proposition: "Improved languages, libraries, and development tools are the principal driver of large software project success."  Again, limit your comments to at most 200 words.

## Week 2
### Tuesday
  * Andrews and Johnson Chaps 4-5
  * Demarco Part II (Pay special attention to section 10 -- very useful insights)

(150 words max) Do a bit of online research regarding office environment at a leading tech firm that offers what would generally be regarded as a high-perks working environment (Google is a good choice, though there are others).   Are these perks frivolous, or do they serve a constructive business purpose?  What purpose if so?

(200 words max) Based on your reading of Andrews and Johnson, what would they have to say regarding the traditional linear waterfall model of development?  Be specific as to reasons they would support it, or critique it, drawing from what they said in the chapters thus far covered.

### Thursday
  * Sims and Johnson -- the whole thing, it's not lengthy

(150 words max) In a Scrum team, which role would you most like to have, and why?

(150 words max) Briefly explain how you think Scrum addresses the issues of: feature creep, too-optimistic estimation, and the tendency to overdesign.

## Week 3
### Tuesday
 * DeMarco, part 3

Assignment is not DeMarco analysis, but a written response to the prompt at the end of the lecture material on tech writing (Explain insertion sort.)

Please do this no *sooner* than 9a on the day of class.
