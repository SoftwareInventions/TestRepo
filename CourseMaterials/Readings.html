   Readings on “understanding the problem”
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Andrews and Johnson: Chaps 1-3
   </li>
   <li>
    DeMarco: Part I
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   DeMarco has a clear opinion regarding effective mamagement of software development.  Many of his ideas are widely accepted, but not all are gospel.  Pick one  major idea in this chapter to challenge, and write a couple of paragraphs explaining why you are unconvinced by what he says.  Limit your response to at most 200 words.  I’ll grade on the quality of the critique, not its length.  In particular, I seek: clear writing, convincing argument, a supporting fact or two, and concise prose.  In class, we’ll ask those picking an idea to defend their view in discussion.
  </p>
  <p>
   Based on your reading of Andrews and Johnson, offer a defense or rebuttal of this proposition: “Improved languages, libraries, and development tools are the principal driver of large software project success.”  Again, limit your comments to at most 200 words.

   (150 words max) Do a bit of online research regarding office environment at a leading tech firm that offers what would generally be regarded as a high-perks working environment (Google is a good choice, though there are others).   Are these perks frivolous, or do they serve a constructive business purpose?  What purpose if so?

  <p>
   (200 words max) Based on your reading of Andrews and Johnson, what would they have to say regarding the traditional linear waterfall model of development?  Be specific as to reasons they would support it, or critique it, drawing from what they said in the chapters thus far covered.

    It is interesting to see elements of Scrum philosophy showing up in Chap 7 of Andrews and Johnson.  Write up to 200 words on which aspects of Scrum you see reflected in the Chap 7 points, and which Chap 7 points are not part of Scrum but might make good additions to the core Scrum model.

   Assignments:

  <ul>
   <li>
    (up to 150 words) Andrews and Johnson’s central point regarding how to choose packaged (aka “third party”) software, and what you really gain from it, can be extended by analogy to what you gain as a programmer by using a suite of library classes or functions, which are a sort of “packaged” software.  Think carefully about what they say about packaged software, and extend their ideas to what you would expect to gain from a class or function library, how you would choose between different libraries for a given task, etc.
   </li>
   <li>
    (Up to 250 words) Propose a one-page WorldFactory for GridWorlds, describing what your generated world will look like, with a brief description of the algorithm you’ll use to generate it.  This assignment is in the same spirit as the EC assignment at the end of 240, but with some important distinctions.  First, it’s an individual assignment, and must be distinctly different from any group project you did in 240.  Second, it’s about demonstrating some interesting code patterns, including loops, conditionals, etc, and writing very clean, well-documented, concise, properly styled, code.  We’ll be code-reviewing each submission, and ranking them by creativity of code, clarity and style, and conciseness.  You need a design that’s more than just some simple pattern-repetitions.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Submit your proposal via Git, as a file “WorldProposal.html” in your personal TestRepo subdirectory, by midnight 2/22.  If you decide to adjust it as you code, that’s fine, but if I collect it, I’ll grade based on the content as of that time.

   (Further web hunting on these two types of roles at other firms, on your initiative.  Quora’s a good resource for “inside perspectives” btw.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Assignments:
   <br/>
   * Code reviews, per usual, but I will break the class into two segments, alphabetically by last name, A-H, K-Z.  We’ll try for
   <em>
    four
   </em>
   reviews on R, hoping to move a bit quicker.  I’ll assign the first two to A-H, and the second two to K-Z, with the alternate group invited to comment but not required to have deeply pre-read the code.  Expect a quiz on the code for your group.
   <br/>
   * (200 words) The PM/TPM positions are Amazon-specific, but I chose them because I have experience with the distinctions between them, and more importantly because they nicely represent an important spectrum within the broader area of software project management.  Be sure you understand the two roles as described by Amazon.  Then comment on four things:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    How this distinction plays out in other software firms – what types of job positions do MS, Google, IBM, Capital One, etc have that reflect the same spectrum?  You don’t have to hunt up every possible company, but get an extra example or two from outside Amazon.
   </li>
   <li>
    Is there a difference in respect/pay between PM and TPM and does this difference vary per organization?
   </li>
   <li>
    How the PM/TPM distinction relates to Scrum roles.
   </li>
   <li>
    Which role you would prefer if you had to choose between them, and why.
   </li>
