<p class=MsoNormal>World Factory Proposal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Andrew Christianson</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2/22/2017</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I propose a world factory for the <i>CodeWorlds </i>program
that generates random circles of bricks, trees, and other fixed elements on the
map. This is to be done using a loop through an array representing the
different tiles of the map. First all tiles would be initialized with a <i>Grass
</i>value. Random center tiles would be chosen. Starting at each center tile x
a random number from a range is assigned as the radius. Using the radius value,
an algorithm could build a circle by assigning elements in the array in a
circular pattern from the center.  There would need to be conditions to prevent
the circle algorithm from attempting to assign values outside of the array and
to prevent a tile from being chosen as a center for a circle if it has already been
used as a center. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a center of a circle falls on a square that is not grass,
it must go to the next available square. If no square left in the array is
grass, the program must end. All tiles falling within the radius would become a
part of a circle and be assigned a randomized fixed tile like rock, tree,
water, etc. This range could be created using a function from a <i>Random </i>object,
and look like “<i>random.nextInt(10)”. </i>There would need to conditions
preventing circles from going outside of the array, loops for creating the
circles, and careful programming for the radius calculations to work correctly.
