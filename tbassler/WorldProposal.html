<p class=MsoNormal>WorldFactory</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*This remains unchanged from the handed-in paper in class*</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The world would generate randomly shaped and sized clumps of
elements.  Herds would consist of an initial animal (leader) placed via
randomly generated coordinates, then each of the 8 adjacent bricks would have a
chance of containing a following member of the heard, and for each follower,
around them is a lower chance follower until all followers have had a chance to
have more followers around them.  This will create random shaped groupings with
a strong bias to group near the leader.  Static elements would be generated
through a similar algorithm, but only along the nearest 4 bricks with a higher
starting chance to spread, with a similar drop-off rate.  Each kind of entity
will be placed at random, type selected at the same time as coordinates. 
Naturally, if there is already an entity in a brick, the placement for that
brick will be skipped.  This should create a fairly natural looking pattern of
entities with a graceful and compact codebase.</p>
