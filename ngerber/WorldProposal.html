<p>For my GridWorlds WorldFactory, I plan on doing a “H-tree” fractal design. I was initially inspired by the elegant recursion of fractals, but I realized that a natural fractal wasn’t feasible with a square grid layout. So, after a bit of research, I discovered an alternative. Deemed the “H-tree” for its obvious shape, the solution I found is a fractal pattern that starts in the middle of a grid and has two child branches that go to opposite sides (can be up and down, alternatively). Each of those children has two child branches that go up and down, and the children of those children have branches that go left and right, etc. The final result is a fractal tree of “H”s, as shown below. Each child branch is slightly smaller than its parent, by a ratio of ~0.75. To add complexity, each branch will have a random series of tiles, but all pairs of children will be identical. The main algorithm will be a function that starts at the center of the grid and produces two opposite branches. For each branch, the function calls itself recursively to produce child branches that split on either side of the parent branch. The orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the parent branch is passed down to the children, as is the length that each child needs to be. A seeded random number generator will guarantee the symmetry of the children. The world should look similar to this:</p>
