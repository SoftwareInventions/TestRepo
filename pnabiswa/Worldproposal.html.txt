Code Worlds ideas:
•	Number of trees and grass could be significantly higher near water bodies
•	There would also be more animals around any trees or water bodies to mimic what would happen in real life.
•	The world will also have animals that could be on trees – sloth.
•	I will also attempt to implement a height map in my world using Carpenters fractal in order to create a river flowing downhill.
•	I will also try to avoid having an animal on a cliff or say a cow in water.
•	I will also attempt to have my river end up in a large water body to mimic a lake.
