	<h2>My World Proposal</h2>
	<br>For my GridWorld, I plan on making a river that divides the world into two biomes.
	<br>The river will be randomly generated so that it starts on the left side of the world,
	<br>randomly winding up and down until it reaches the right side of the world.
	<br>The two resulting regions will individually be assigned one of two biomes: forest or rock field.
	<br>Forests will be originally generated with trees on 75% of the grid spaces.
	<br>However, due to lack of sunlight, any tree that is surrounded
	<br>by other trees on its four adjacent sides will die off and
	<br>be removed from the world before being displayed.  Finally, each rock field will generate stones in a
	<br>random mounding fashion.  The generator will go across the biome from left to right, deciding for
	<br>each grid location, whether or not a stone should be placed.  Two factors help determine the chance of a
	<br>stone being placed there: the number of other stones around that grid spot and the total number of 
	<br>stones that have been placed.  If more stones have already been placed around the location in question,
	<br>there will be a higher probably that another stone will be placed.
	<br>However, as more stones are placed across the entire biome, the probability that another stone is placed is lowered.
