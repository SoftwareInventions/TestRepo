<p>My idea for creating a WorldFactory that generates a random CodeWorld map comes from some external research that I did on world generation. My plan is to generate a HeightMap which is typically used for computer graphics to display shadows, but it is essentially 2D array with height as its values. Using this I can filter different ranges of heights to correspond to different elements in CodeWorlds such as trees, rocks, and water, which will create a more gradual and logical grouping of elements. Ideally I imagine the peak height being near the center, and then randomly, but gradually decreasing height with radius. If rock represents the highest points, grass and trees in the middle, and water at the lowest, it may begin to look like an island with a rocky peak. The process for creating this world will begin with generating the HeightMap, which may actually be the most difficult process. After the map is created, I can just split it into bands of values which will represent different elements. Then once the base elements are placed, I can go back and place animals and other ornamental entities. </p>
